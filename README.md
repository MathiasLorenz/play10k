# play10k
My version of the dice game ten thousand. The rules can be found (in danish) [here](https://terningspil.dk/regler-til-10000-terningspil/). Note that the 'staircase' (1-2-3-4-5-6) currently does not give points as I usually don't play with this rule.

Only a CLI version is currently implemented. The back- and frontend are seperated so another UI could be used with the current backend. I do not have any plans to add another UI to the game, though.
